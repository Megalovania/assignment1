  1. Fork your own version of this repo

    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

    <ul>
      <li>I was first exposed to HTML in my freshman year of high school. Back then all we 
        really did was use tables (yuck). If I remember correctly the final product was just 
      a site with Eagles memorabilia.</li>
      <li>In my freshman year of college, we created a personal website which implemented 
      some javascript that asked the user 3 questions: What is your name? What is your quest? 
        &amp; What is your favorite color? The site would then use this information to welcome 
        the user and change the color of the background.</li>
      <li>Following the personal we were tasked with creating a team page. This ended up being 
      a mock store for Tribbles. User's were able to submit forms requesting Tribbles. Little did 
      they know the trouble they would bring.</li>
